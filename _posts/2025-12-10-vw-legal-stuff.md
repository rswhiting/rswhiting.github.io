I bought a VW Beetle with no title--it was a parts car that the previous owner was going to use for a different project, but never got around to it. I didn't know the process until I saw the listing, but I figured out how to get a title for it and made a plan before I picked it up. Hopefully this helps someone else in a similar situation.

In Idaho, you can apply for a bonded title if you don't have the original title. The process is documented on the form [ITD 3405](https://itd.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3405.pdf). Here's how it works:

1. Try to find the previous owner (www.vehicleregistry.gov) and get them to fill out a "release of interest" form (ITD 3332) if possible. If you can't find them, you can still proceed without it. You can also send certified mail to the last known address of the owner to notify them of your intent to apply for a bonded title.
1. Fill out the form with as much information as you can about the vehicle (VIN, make, model, year, color, etc). You also need to provide a reason why you don't have the title (e.g., lost, never had one, etc). I made sure to have have the seller sign a bill of sale with the VIN and sale price on it.
1. Get a VIN inspection. I stressed about this more than I should have. I was trying to figure out how to tow it to the DMV, but it turns out you can have a law enforcement officer (like a sheriff's deputy) do the inspection wherever the car is located. I called the local sheriff's office, and they sent an officer out to inspect the car at my house. It took about 15 minutes, and he filled out the form for me ([ITD 3403](https://itd.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3403.pdf)). I had a copy of the form ready for the officer to fill out. He told me it hadn't been registered about a decade--so I was in the clear.
1. I took the inspection form, bill of sale, and completed bonded title application to the DMV, and after paying title and taxes, they issued me a bonded title. Because the car is over 10 years old there was no bond required.

The bonded title is valid for 3 years. If no one comes forward to claim ownership of the vehicle during that time, you can apply for a regular title after the bond period expires. I got the title in the mail in a week or two--way faster than I expected. It'll take me a while to get this car roadworthy anyway, so the timing works out well.

I resisted purchasing anything until I had the title in hand, since I didn't want to waste money on parts for a car that I couldn't legally own. Now that I have the title, I can move forward with the conversion project!

Sorry, no pictures for this post--it's mostly paperwork and phone calls. Protip: the DMV and sheriff's office can help answer questions and get you through the process!
