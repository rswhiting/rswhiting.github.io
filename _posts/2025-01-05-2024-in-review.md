Some people have a real aversion to New Years resolutions because of how often they fail or how cliche they sound. New Years resolutions often remind people of their past failures to stand by their own commitments, and there is pain there. I firmly believe in regular reflection on the past in order to recognize places to change and move. Intentional course corrections are a vital part of navigating this chaotic life.

To recall the major event, growth, and impacts on my life over the last year, I often go back and review the 7 areas of life and consider what impactful things happened in each of them (often overlapping): spiritual, physical, career, financial, intellectual, family, and social.

## Big changes in all my communities

2024 provided a seismic shift in my communities. I would argue that only moving between cities would cause a more dramatic shift in communities in such a short timespan. In 2024, we were left with no choice but to leave the church community we loved because of unyielding and unhealthy leadership decisions. If I hadn't been on the leadership team, I could have happily moved along in ignorance under the senior pastor's guidance, but as an elder and board member, my conscience would not allow us to stay without major repentance and change by the leadership boards. 

The following month, Intuit laid off 1800 people globally and closed the Boise site. After five years working with an amazing team to build the best time-tracking software in the world, we had 2 days to packed our boxes and walked away in shock. Many small groups have kept up communication, but that community as a cohesive unit was utterly shattered and scattered to the winds in search of employment. Intuit provided a good severance, so the financial strain was greatly decreased. I disagree with the choice Intuit made, but I still can't find any anger for Intuit in me. During my time with Intuit, I built many great friendships, learned leadership in a new way, grew my net worth, doubled my generosity and more, and added to my family in irreplaceable ways.

In the midst of this upheaval and stress, I still found moments of peace, hope, and clarity. 

## Insight in my career trajectory

I had a lot of time to think about my career. Each new application provided an opportunity to imagine a future with a different company. I though a lot about what "retirement" could look like in the distant future or what entrepreneurship could look like in my situation.

In the end, I'm thrilled to work with SwineTech so that I can again work with a small team solving real problems for everyday workers. I knew almost nothing about pig farming in America, and now I'm writing product roadmaps and meeting with vendors and partners to make their lives better and their pigs healthier.

Like any startup, the goal is to do great things and find a great exit, which makes me think of the next 5 years as a chapter rather than a destination.

If I could "retire" after that, I would probably fill my time with study, writing books, and become an adjunct professor of computer science at BSU and Bible at Boise Bible College. 

## Family growth and unity

It's amazing how a family can grow and change in a single year. In our first year after adoption, I foolishly thought that the general family dynamics had come to rest like some kind of equilibrium after a good shake. After year 2, the dynamics between siblings has undergone slow but undeniable change in a positive direction. We still have unique meltdowns by each child for their own reasons, but they all continue to grow and surprise us with creativity, growth, and maturity (in fits, spurts, and regressions).

## The end is in sight for my masters degree

I began my masters degree with Liberty University in the fall of 2022 to help direct my thirst for study and knowledge, and if my classes continue according to plan, I should have a masters in biblical exposition at the end of summer (or fall if I need to push out overlapping summer classes). I started the journey without a specific endpoint in mind--I just wanted a more directed vision for my studies.

Since starting the degree program, I jested that I could start a PhD program after completing my masters. Becca has wisely pushed back and suggested that I do something in between like write a book, pastor a church, or take up a different hobby before jumping into more classes. She's probably right. I have a few books in mind and a children's bible curriculum that is begging to be written. I'm excited to see what we decide this coming fall.

## Peace in my daily reset

Ever since we moved to this house in Boise, I've walked a dog most mornings through the loops and cul-de-sacs of our neighborhood. Over the years, I've formed some favorites and patterns. It is by far my favorite daily reset.

I usually walk between 1 and 3 miles beginning with a sermon or bible-related podcast. After that, I take off the headphones and pray. I usually begin with the Lord's prayer in an ever-changing applicable and modern format, and then I pour our my heart to my father: fears, grief, pain, concerns, joy, thankfulness, and gratitude. I lift up situations, neighbors, friends, and family before this loving God. It's the single most humble, clear, and beautiful part of my day--which is why I have a growing resentment for rain. Then I go face the day.

If I could hold onto any single practice or habit for this coming year, it would be this one. With the demands and pressures of fatherhood, management, and leadership, it is often the only moment of peace and clarity in my day. 

It's late afternoon now, but I didn't get a walk this morning, so I'm going on a walk now.

## 2025

So what's next?

I hope to build a home-office in the garage to make working from home full time more pleasant. I hope to graduate with my first masters degree at the end of summer. I hope to continue to cook and bake and clean the kitchen regularly. I hope to continue studying the bible and Hebrew. I hope to find opportunities to teach and point people toward the way of Jesus. I hope to reach out to and reconnect with my highschool classmates this year--we graduated 20 years ago! I hope to build my relationship with my wonderful wife and children. I hope to bring unity, laughter, and financial success to SwineTech. I regularly ask for and hope for more of the way of Yahweh to become a reality in my family, neighborhood, city, state, country, and world: with peace for the weary, justice for the poor, hope for the immigrant, and joy for the outcast.

Happy new year.
